# Air Quality Index Analysis of Indian Cities

This Power BI project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) in various cities across India. The analysis uses a range of KPIs to provide insights into pollution levels, trends, and key air pollutants. Visualizations such as maps and line charts help in understanding air quality variations across regions and over time.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:
- Identify the most and least polluted cities in India.
- Provide an area-wise AQI overview using map visualizations.
- Display AQI trends over the years.
- Analyze the average concentration of harmful pollutants such as CO, NO, SO2, and PM 2.5.
