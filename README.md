# Air Quality Index Analysis of Indian Cities

This Power BI project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) in various cities across India. The analysis uses a range of KPIs to provide insights into pollution levels, trends, and key air pollutants. Visualizations such as maps and line charts help in understanding air quality variations across regions and over time.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:
- Identify the most and least polluted cities in India.
- Provide an area-wise AQI overview using map visualizations.
- Display AQI trends over the years.
- Analyze the average concentration of harmful pollutants such as CO, NO, SO2, and PM 2.5.

- ### 1. Most Polluted Cities
- Identifies cities with the highest AQI values.
- Highlights the regions with severe pollution levels, requiring immediate attention.

### 2. Least Polluted Cities
- Shows cities with the lowest AQI levels.
- Offers a comparison to understand which cities have better air quality.

### 3. Area-wise AQI Overview (Map Chart)
- A geographical view of AQI distribution across India.
- The bubble size is based on AQI levels, making it easy to identify pollution hotspots and cleaner areas.

### 4. AQI Trend Overview (Line Chart of Yearly AQI)
- A line chart showing AQI trends over time.
- Tracks whether air quality is improving, stagnating, or worsening in different cities over the years.

### 5. Average CO Levels
- Displays the average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in various cities.
- Provides insights into the contribution of CO to overall pollution.

### 6. Average NO Levels
- Measures the average nitrogen oxide (NO) levels across cities.
- Helps understand NO's impact on air quality and public health.

### 7. Average SO2 Levels
- Shows the average sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentration in the atmosphere.
- Highlights cities with high SO2 levels, known to contribute to respiratory problems and acid rain.

  ### 8. Average PM 2.5 Levels
- Monitors the average levels of PM 2.5, a critical air pollutant with harmful effects on health.
- Focuses on regions with high particulate matter pollution.

## Visualizations
- **Map Chart:** Provides an area-wise overview of AQI distribution across Indian cities.
- **Line Chart:** Displays the yearly AQI trend, highlighting changes in air quality over time.
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Displays the Cities with the highest and lowest AQI.

  ## Conclusion
This Power BI project serves as a data-driven tool to monitor and analyze air quality in India, identifying pollution trends and contributing factors. It provides a clear overview to take data-backed actions towards improving Air quality.
